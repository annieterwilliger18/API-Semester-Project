# API-Semester-Project
Using NYC OpenData, I was able to create a single-page API showing two different types of charts with a key description of what is shown in the charts and data itself. 

The dataset that I chose was the Public Design Commission Outdoor Public Art Inventory. Here a number of ArtWork Types, Artists, Title of the Artwork, and locations within New York City. 

The first chart shows ArtWork Type 2 which has a total of 5 different categories and it displays the number of each category found within the dataset. 

The second chart shows ArtWork Type 1 which has over 20 different categories, but the chart itself displays the top 13 which was the most frequently recorded categoreis discovered within Type 1. 

Along with the two different charts, I also added a key description which says the number of each type found within the graph.
